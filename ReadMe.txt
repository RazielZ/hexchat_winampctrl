* If foobar2000 is being used with foo_winamp_spam, &7 can be configured in **Library > Configure > Winamp API Emulator**
* To have */wp* output, for example, **`(Nick) is listening to: Shpongle - Nothing is Something Worth Doing [2:15/6:25]`**:
  * foobar2000's foo\_winamp_spam should be set with something like
     * **`[%artist% - ]$if(%title%,%title%,%_filename%)`**.
  * XChat's "**dispcurrsong**" user command should be set to
     * **`me is listening to: &7[%5/%6]`**
